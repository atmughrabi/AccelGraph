# pslse.parms is a hard coded file name for the PSLSE parameters file.
# This file can be used to override the default settings of parameters.
#
# File may contain comment lines starting with '#' or blank lines.
#
# For parameter lines the format is the following:
# PARM:{value}
# PARM:{min_value},{max_value}
#
# When min_value and max_value are provided then for each run PSLSE
# will pick a random value in that range.
#

# Timeout delay in seconds: If 0 then timeouts are disabled.
TIMEOUT:10

# Percentage chance of PSL driving any pending responses in a clock cycle.
# Can not be 0 otherwise PSL will never generate responses to commands.
# Setting to 100 will cause all responses to be very rapid and generally
# those responses will be in order.
# Lower values introduces delays on responses and allows for greater
# randomization of response ordering.
RESPONSE_PERCENT:10,20

# Percentage chance of PSL responding with PAGED for any response.
PAGED_PERCENT:2,4
