The regress.py script is a Python script that is used to run the entire list
of regression tests.  It accomplishes this through xml files that define how
the tests should be run.  It will automatically attempt to parse every xml
file that is found in this directory.

The tests are themselves are build as C code files in the tests directory.
All these tests will use one or more Test AFU devices.  The Test AFU is the
C++ code in the afu directory.

Each xml file configures one or more Test AFUs which will be started by the
regress.py script.  The xml file also configures the pslse which will also be
started by regress.py.  Each xml file can only contain a single afu/pslse
configuration.  However, multiple tests can be run sequentially on a single
configuration.  Each test must be identified by a name="" parameter in the test
element.  All parameters to be passed to a test are defined as child elements
of that test in the xml file.

If regress.py detects a fail it will exit immediately leaving log files that
can be examine to determined how the fail occured.

If regress.py detects pass conditions for all tests then it will clean up after
itself at the end of the run.
