If your simulator requires that you build 32-bit code even on a 64-bit
machine then you can force this with BIT32.

Example:

Instead of building like this:

>make

Do this:

>BIT32=y make

If you have attempted to build and it fails to link then start over fresh with:

>make clean

After make clean attempt 32-bit build again.
